# JobTrek - A Job Tracking Web App
JobTrek is a web-based job tracking application that allows job seekers to easily keep track of their job search progress.

The app allows users to add jobs they have applied to, track the status of each application, and receive updates on any changes to the status of the job.

With JobTrek, job seekers can quickly and easily see which jobs they have applied to, what stage the application is in, and whether or not they have been accepted or rejected. This eliminates the need to search through emails or keep a separate spreadsheet, making the job search process less overwhelming and more organized.

The app features a clean, user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate.

JobTrek is a must-have tool for anyone actively searching for a job. Try it now and take control of your job search!

The frontend of the app is built with ReactJS, utilizing the Redux Toolkit for state management and TailwindCSS for styling. Data is fetched using the Axios library.

The backend is built with NodeJS and ExpressJS, and media uploads are handled by Cloudinary.
